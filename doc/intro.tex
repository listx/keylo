\section{Introduction}

\textbf{Keylo} optimizes the layout for a given arbitrary keyboard.
Currently, it only supports the letters of the English alphabet of 26 letters.
Due to the sheer search space of \[26! \approx 4.03 \times 10^{26}\] layouts even with just 26 keys, it uses a stochastic optimization technique known as \textit{simulated annealing}.
